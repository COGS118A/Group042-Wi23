				"# Abstract \n",
				"The goal that we want to solve is to help the world find an answer to whatever it is that they are askiung for. We thought back to how when we were young, we ould ask a magiuc 8 ball anything and recieve an answer, but what if we can somehow manipulate this so that the magic 8 ball can be more like how CHAT GPT is for everyone nowadays. Where the user will ask a question they feel they need an answer to that is not necessarily academic, and unlik eCHAT GPT, it can be about anything with no restrictions and still recieve an answer.The data we will be utizilizing is yet to be determined but we plan on taking a public poll from our peers on what questions they would really want answered and it can be about anythig. Lastly, success will be measured when an adequate answered can be given that means satisfactory for the one who is asking or magic 8 ball. The data used throughout this project represents what the user will be inputing in the format of a question and it will be measured through various responses that are placed into the code to give the user a variety of different answers for what they are asking. Lastly, performance will be measured if the answers given back actually make sense for what is asked, if it is too random then this will be measured as a failure since our goal here is to give back the user a answer thewy can be happy with. \n"

				"# Proposed Solution\n",
				"\n",
				"Our proposed solution to make sure that the user will get an answer which makes senmse is by implementing ocde that notices what the user is askign to give backj a specific answer. We currently decided to use if statements. So, if our user starts off by asking a 'can' question it would give back a certain reply. This is how we plan to make sure this project can get interesting. While it may seem basic to be working this, it is so fun to do this. We know that classes can be seriuous at times but with this project and the liberty we have to do what we want with this is just so awesome and we truly are havign a great time working on this. We hope our final product can help others see that this is something cool and can be played around with."

    "- In the begining we starteds off with only a few answers to any given question and as of right now, we have a total of 14 answers. While thisn is an im  provement, we do not consider thnis a pass because while we do have a good amount of answers, they appear to be random rather than being meanful to ny given question. This currently is a struggle fopr us because we want to make the output not seem random. Or at least that is our current goal. Here is small part of our code to showcase the output, first we have the answers which we numbered as 'Answer 1' and then we can ask any given question and to make it interesting the output first starts off by stating, 'Oh hello there, did not expect to see anyone around this time. My name is Steven but most people call me the magical 8 ball haha. Well enter your name, this helps me sink into the many alternate timelines to give you a concrete answer' which then the user casn place their name and then it will be prompted with (If you put your name as Jake for example) 'Jake, Ahh yess! I knew you would come here. Get it? Sorry my humors all ROUND up. Hahah because I'm a ball. Well anyways, ask away..' That is the current outpouts we have and we want to expand upon this to make it even more unique and ofc ourse after a question is asked it will reply with any of the 14 different answers.
