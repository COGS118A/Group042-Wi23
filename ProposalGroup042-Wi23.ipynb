				"The goal that we want to solve is to help the world find an answer to whatever it is that they are askiung for. We thought back to how when we were young, we ould ask a magiuc 8 ball anything and recieve an answe, but what if we can somehow manipulate thi sso that the magic 8 ball can be more like how CHAT GPT is for everyone nowadays. Where the ser will ask a question they feel they need an answer to that is not necessarily academic, and unlik eCHAT GPT, it ccan be about anything with no restrictions and still recieve an answer.The data we will be utizilizing is yet to be determined but we plan on taking a public poll from our peers on what questions they would really want answered and it can be about anythig. Lastly, success will be measured when an adequate answered can be given that means satisfactory for the one who is asking or magic 8 ball. \n"

				"# Background\n",
				"\n",
				"A great example that inspired us to want to do this project is of corse from the creators of CHAT GPT, with thiis statement 'Sam Altman believes that the institutions of the world should be prepared for AI and it won't take much time for current AI to transition to 'potentially scary ones' this was a statement given by the creator of CHAT GPT, Sam Altman. This helped motivate us to want to do a different approach on what CHAT GPT has accomplished but this time with no boundaries.\n",
				"\n",
				"Sammy is simply amazing ND WONDERFUL AND IM OBSSED WITH HERRRR <3 .\n",
				"\n",
				"Another example is from Elon Musk with Neural Link. Stated by Neural Links main website is, 'Every day weâ€™re building better tools intended to communicate with the brain. With the right team, the potential applications for this technology are limitless', with what Elon Musk is trying to accomplish, it helped motivate us to do more research on exactly what Neural Link plans on doing.\n",
				"\n",
				"While this magic 8 ball by any means does not and will not be implemented into any brains, we still want to accomplish a better connection with machine and with learning by being able to ask any questionn with a limitless answer provided for the user."

				"# Problem Statement\n",
				"\n",
				"In this project, we want to be able to help individuals get a satisfactory answer for whatever it may be that they want to ask. Whether it is a simple question or a personal one, we want our magic 8 ball to be able to help others. \n",
				"Above all, we want to do the best we can\n"

				"\n",
				"At the moment we are uncertain exactly of what sort of data we will be implementing into the finalized project, byut the genreral iidea we have is the criitical variables will be depending on the certain questions asked to our magic 8 ball."

				"\n",
				"If the questiion is one that requires an academic approach, then the answer willl be appropriate in those terms. And if a person decides to ask a question that may seem private, then the answer given back will be given a manner that will be appropiate for the user."

				"\n",
				"Another concern is that we may not be able to make the greatest magic 8 ball to perform in the best way possible. But this is just more of a personal problem and we are still going to try our absolute best to make the best final project that we can as a team."
