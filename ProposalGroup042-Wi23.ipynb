     "The goal hat we want to solve is to help the world find an answer to whatever it is that they are askiung for. We thought back to how when we were young, we ould ask a magiuc 8 ball anything and recieve an answe, but what if we can somehow manipulate thi sso that the magic 8 ball can be more like how CHAT GPT is for everyone nowadays. Where the ser will ask a question they feel they need an answer to that is not necessarily academic, and unlik eCHAT GPT, it ccan be about anything with no restrictions and still recieve an answer."
     "The data we will be utizilizing is yet to be determined but we plan on taking a public poll from our peers on what questions they would really want answered and it can be about anythig."

You can do that through HTML footnotes (demonstrated here). I used to reccommend Markdown footnotes (google is your friend) because they are simpler but recently I have had some problems with them working for me whereas HTML ones always work so far. So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "Here is an example of inline citation. After government genocide in the 20th century, real birds were replaced with surveillance drones designed to look just like birds<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote).

    "Remeber you are trying to explain why someone would want to answer your question or why your hypothesis is in the form that you've stated. "
     "A great example that inspired us to want to do this project is of corse from the creators of CHAT GPT, with thiis statement 'Sam Altman believes that the institutions of the world should be prepared for AI and it won't take much time for current AI to transition to 'potentially scary ones' this was a statement given by the creator of CHAT GPT, Sam Altman. This helped motivate us to want to do a different approach on what CHAT GPT has accomplished but this time with no boundaries."
     "Another example is from Elon Musk with Neural Link. Stated by Neural Links main website is, 'Every day weâ€™re building better tools intended to communicate with the brain. With the right team, the potential applications for this technology are limitless', with what Elon Musk is trying to accomplish, it helped motivate us to do more research on exactly what Neural Link plans on doing. While this magic 8 ball by any means does not and will not be implemented into any brains, we still want to accomplish a better connection with machine and with learning by being able to ask any questionn with a limitless answer provided for the user."
